7. Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)

   Containerized my application during the livestream. The first time I tried containerizing the app, it didn't work. It took retracing my steps to realize I forgot        to set the enviorment variables. Files: [Frontend](https://github.com/Gamerrethink/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-1/frontend-react-js/dockerfile), [Backend](https://github.com/Gamerrethink/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-1/backend-flask/dockerfile), and [Composer](https://github.com/Gamerrethink/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-1/docker-compose.yml) 
   
8. Document the Notification Endpoint for the OpenAI Document	
Started the containers for Cruddur and created an account in the app. Documented the notification endpoint OpenAI document by updating the file [openapi-3.0.yml](https://github.com/Gamerrethink/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-1/backend-flask/services/notifications_activities.py).

9. Write a Flask Backend Endpoint for Notifications and Write a React Page for Notifications	

Activated the notifications feature by writing a Flask backend endpoint and writing a react page for notifications. Files: [app.js](https://github.com/Gamerrethink/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-1/frontend-react-js/src/App.js), [app.py](https://github.com/Gamerrethink/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-1/backend-flask/app.py), and [notification_activities.py](https://github.com/Gamerrethink/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-1/backend-flask/services/notifications_activities.py).

10. Run DynamoDB Local Container and Run Postgres Container and ensure they both work

Updated [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Gamerrethink/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-1/docker-compose.yml) to support both the DynamoDB and Postgres databases. Also updated [.gitpod.yml](https://github.com/Gamerrethink/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-1/.gitpod.yml) to launch postgres during workspace startup.

Homework Challenges

- Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script
- Push and tag a image to DockerHub (they have a free tier)
- Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build
- Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
- Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile
- Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces
- Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes.
